## Backend Integration Status
- **Local-First Architecture**: App works completely offline without backend
- **Local Storage**: SQLite database for all user data and training sessions
- **Optional Sync**: Raku backend integration will be optional for data sync
- **Original Raku backend**: `/home/lancew/dev/MyJudo/` (for future sync feature)
- **No Authentication Required**: Users can start using the app immediately

## Development Commands
```bash
# Run Flutter app on desktop (local-first, no backend needed)
cd /home/lancew/dev/myjudo_flutter && flutter run -d linux

# Run Flutter app on Android emulator (local-first, no backend needed)
cd /home/lancew/dev/myjudo_flutter && flutter run -d emulator-5554

# Check available devices
flutter devices

# Check available emulators
flutter emulators

# Launch Android emulator
flutter emulators --launch pixel_android30

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run tests
flutter test

# Build for release
flutter build apk --release  # Android
flutter build ios --release  # iOS

# Optional: Start Raku backend (only needed for future sync feature)
cd /home/lancew/dev/MyJudo && raku service.p6
```
