## Immediate Next Steps (High Priority) ðŸš¨

### Backend API Integration
- [ ] Add JSON API endpoints to Raku backend at `/home/lancew/dev/MyJudo/`:
  - [ ] `GET /api/user/{username}` - Return user data as JSON instead of HTML
  - [ ] `GET /api/training-sessions/{userId}` - Return training sessions as JSON
  - [ ] `POST /api/training-session/add` - Accept JSON payload for new sessions
  - [ ] `PUT /api/training-session/{id}` - Accept JSON payload for session updates
  - [ ] `DELETE /api/training-session/{id}` - Delete training session

### Testing Integration
- [ ] Start Raku backend server: `cd /home/lancew/dev/MyJudo && raku service.p6`
- [ ] Test Flutter app: `cd /home/lancew/dev/myjudo_flutter && flutter run -d linux`
- [ ] Verify login/register functionality works
- [ ] Test API endpoints with actual data

## Medium Priority Features ðŸ“‹

### Additional Screens
- [ ] Add training session screen with form for creating new sessions
- [ ] Edit training session screen with pre-populated form
- [ ] Password reset screen (integrate with existing Raku functionality)
- [ ] User profile/settings screen
- [ ] Statistics/analytics screen with charts

### Enhanced Functionality
- [ ] Implement technique picker with judo technique categories
- [ ] Add date picker for session dates
- [ ] Implement session type selection (randori, kata, etc.)
- [ ] Add validation for duplicate sessions
- [ ] Implement pull-to-refresh on all list screens
- [ ] Add search/filter functionality for training sessions

### Data Management
- [ ] Add offline support with local SQLite database
- [ ] Implement data synchronization between local and remote
- [ ] Add data export functionality (CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Implement data backup/restore features

## Mobile Development Setup ðŸ“±

### Android Development
- [ ] Install Android Studio from AUR: `yay -S android-studio`
- [ ] Configure Android SDK and emulators
- [ ] Test app on Android emulator: `flutter run -d android`
- [ ] Test on physical Android device via USB debugging

### iOS Development (if needed)
- [ ] Requires macOS with Xcode
- [ ] Configure iOS development certificates
- [ ] Test on iOS simulator: `flutter run -d ios`

## App Store Preparation ðŸš€

### Android Play Store
- [ ] Create app icons for different resolutions
- [ ] Configure app signing certificates
- [ ] Set up proper app permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
- [ ] Create app screenshots and store listing
- [ ] Build release APK: `flutter build apk --release`

### iOS App Store
- [ ] Configure iOS bundle identifier
- [ ] Set up iOS certificates and provisioning profiles
- [ ] Create iOS app icons and launch screens
- [ ] Build iOS release: `flutter build ios --release`

## Code Quality & Optimization ðŸ”§

### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for models and services
- [ ] Write widget tests for screens
- [ ] Write integration tests for user flows
- [ ] Add automated testing to CI/CD pipeline

### Performance

- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Optimize API calls and reduce network requests

### Security
- [ ] Implement biometric authentication (fingerprint/face unlock)
- [ ] Add certificate pinning for API calls
- [ ] Implement secure storage for sensitive data
- [ ] Add rate limiting and request validation

## UI/UX Improvements ðŸŽ¨

### Design
- [ ] Add custom app icons and splash screens
- [ ] Implement dark mode support
- [ ] Add animations and transitions
- [ ] Improve accessibility (screen readers, etc.)
- [ ] Add internationalization (i18n) support

### User Experience
- [ ] Add onboarding flow for new users
- [ ] Implement push notifications for training reminders
- [ ] Add training streak tracking and achievements
- [ ] Create data visualization charts and graphs

## Documentation ðŸ“š
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Create API documentation for backend endpoints
- [ ] Write user manual/help documentation
- [ ] Create deployment guides

## Technical Debt ðŸ”¨
- [ ] Implement proper error handling throughout app
- [ ] Add logging and crash reporting
- [ ] Refactor ApiService to use proper REST client
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection
- [ ] Add configuration management for different environments
