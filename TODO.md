- [x] **Authentication requirements removed: login/register screens and logic deleted, app is now local-first**

## Immediate Next Steps (High Priority) ðŸš¨

### Local-First Architecture Implementation
- [x] Remove authentication requirements (app works without login)
- [x] Implement local SQLite database for data storage
- [x] Create local data models and repositories
- [x] Replace API-dependent screens with local data screens

- [ ] Add responsive design for different screen sizes
- [ ] Optimize UI for mobile-first experience
- [ ] Convert home screen to work with local data
- [ ] Update navigation to skip authentication **(Done)**

### Core Local Features
- [x] Implement local training session CRUD operations
- [x] Add duration to each training session
- [ ] Add local user profile/settings storage
- [ ] Create local statistics calculation
- [ ] Implement local data export (JSON, CSV)
- [ ] Add local data backup/restore functionality

## Medium Priority Features ðŸ“‹

### Additional Screens (Local-First)
- [ ] Add training session screen with form for creating new sessions
- [ ] Edit training session screen with pre-populated form
- [ ] User profile/settings screen (local storage)
- [ ] Statistics/analytics screen with charts from local data
- [ ] Data export/import screen
- [ ] Backup/restore screen

### Enhanced Functionality
- [ ] Implement technique picker with judo technique categories

- [ ] Implement session type selection (randori, kata, etc.)
- [ ] Add validation for duplicate sessions
- [ ] Implement pull-to-refresh on all list screens
- [ ] Add search/filter functionality for training sessions
- [ ] Add local data migration/versioning

### Optional Web Sync (Future)
- [ ] Add optional account creation/login
- [ ] Implement data synchronization between local and remote
- [ ] Add conflict resolution for sync
- [ ] Implement incremental sync
- [ ] Add sync status indicators
- [ ] Handle offline/online state transitions

## Mobile Development Setup ðŸ“±

### Android Development âœ…
- [x] Install Android Studio from AUR: `yay -S android-studio`
- [x] Configure Android SDK and emulators
- [x] Test app on Android emulator: `flutter run -d android`
- [ ] Test on physical Android device via USB debugging

### iOS Development (if needed)
- [ ] Requires macOS with Xcode
- [ ] Configure iOS development certificates
- [ ] Test on iOS simulator: `flutter run -d ios`

## App Store Preparation ðŸš€

### Android Play Store
- [ ] Create app icons for different resolutions
