# Contributing to MyJudo Flutter

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MyJudo Flutter! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

1. **Install Flutter SDK** (3.32.6 or higher)
2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lancew/myjudo-flutter.git
   cd myjudo-flutter
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d linux  # For desktop testing
   ```

## Backend Setup

The app connects to a Raku backend. To test full functionality:

1. Clone the backend repository: `https://github.com/lancew/MyJudo`
2. Start the backend server: `raku service.p6`
3. The Flutter app will connect to `http://localhost`

## Code Style

- Follow Dart's official style guide
- Use `flutter format` before committing
- Run `flutter analyze` to check for issues
- Ensure all tests pass with `flutter test`

## Git Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes** and commit:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: your feature description"
   ```
4. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Clear description**: Explain what your PR does and why
- **Reference issues**: Link to related GitHub issues
- **Tests**: Add tests for new functionality
- **Documentation**: Update README or comments if needed
- **One feature per PR**: Keep PRs focused and manageable

## Commit Message Format

- `Add: new feature description`
- `Fix: bug description`
- `Update: change description`
- `Refactor: code improvement description`
